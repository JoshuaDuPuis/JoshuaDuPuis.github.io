                    During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing and limited group gatherings are necessary to minimize the spread of the virus, however within places such as the Russell House Student Union at the University of South Carolina, it is difficult for students to social distance in long lines around meal times as lines for restaurants tend to spew into walkways and common spaces. This leaves students and other diners more susceptible to catching the virus while trying to get something to eat.
